Abstract
We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which
data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions. Our approach
is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective do-
main transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot
| discriminate |     | between | the training | (source) | and test | (target) | domains. |     |

The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that

main(nolabeledtarget-domaindataisnecessary). Asthetrainingprogresses,theapproach
promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task

1. Introduction
The cost of generating labeled data for a new machine learning task is often an obstacle
for applying machine learning methods. In particular, this is a limiting factor for the fur-
ther progress of deep neural network architectures, that have already brought impressive
advances to the state-of-the-art across a wide variety of machine-learning tasks and appli-
cations. For problems lacking labeled data, it may be still possible to obtain training sets
that are big enough for training large-scale deep models, but that suffer from the shift in
data distribution from the actual data encountered at “test time”. One important example
is training an image classifier on synthetic or semi-synthetic images, which may come in
abundance and be fully labeled, but which inevitably have a distribution that is different
fromrealimages(LiebeltandSchmid,2010;Starketal.,2010;V´azquezetal.,2014;Sunand
Saenko, 2014). Another example is in the context of sentiment analysis in written reviews,
where one might have labeled data for reviews of one type of product (e.g., movies), while
having the need to classify reviews of other products (e.g., books).
Learning a discriminative classifier or other predictor in the presence of a shift be-
tween training and test distributions is known as domain adaptation (DA). The proposed
approaches build mappings between the source (training-time) and the target (test-time)
domains, so that the classifier learned for the source domain can also be applied to the
target domain, when composed with the learned mapping between domains. The appeal
of the domain adaptation approaches is the ability to learn a mapping between domains in
the situation when the target domain data are either fully unlabeled (unsupervised domain
annotation) or have few labeled samples (semi-supervised domain adaptation). Below, we
focusontheharderunsupervisedcase,althoughtheproposedapproach(domain-adversarial
learning) can be generalized to the semi-supervised case rather straightforwardly.
Unlike many previous papers on domain adaptation that worked with fixed feature
representations, wefocusoncombiningdomainadaptationanddeepfeaturelearningwithin
one training process. Our goal is to embed domain adaptation into the process of learning
representation, so that the final classification decisions are made based on features that
are both discriminative and invariant to the change of domains, i.e., have the same or
very similar distributions in the source and the target domains. In this way, the obtained
feed-forward network can be applicable to the target domain without being hindered by
the shift between the two domains. Our approach is motivated by the theory on domain
adaptation (Ben-David et al., 2006, 2010), that suggests that a good representation for
cross-domain transfer is one for which an algorithm cannot learn to identify the domain of
origin of the input observation.
We thus focus on learning features that combine (i) discriminativeness and (ii) domain-
invariance. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the underlying features as well as two
discriminative classifiers operating on these features: (i) the label predictor that predicts
class labels and is used both during training and at test time and (ii) the domain classifier
that discriminates between the source and the target domains during training. While the
parametersoftheclassifiersareoptimizedinordertominimizetheirerroronthetrainingset,
the parameters of the underlying deep feature mapping are optimized in order to minimize
the loss of the label classifier and to maximize the loss of the domain classifier. The latter

features to emerge in the course of the optimization.
Crucially, we show that all three training processes can be embedded into an appro-
priately composed deep feed-forward network, called domain-adversarial neural network
(DANN) (illustrated by Figure 1, page 12) that uses standard layers and loss functions,
and can be trained using standard backpropagation algorithms based on stochastic gradi-
ent descent or its modifications (e.g., SGD with momentum). The approach is generic as
a DANN version can be created for almost any existing feed-forward architecture that is
trainable by backpropagation. In practice, the only non-standard component of the pro-
posed architecture is a rather trivial gradient reversal layer that leaves the input unchanged
during forward propagation and reverses the gradient by multiplying it by a negative scalar
during the backpropagation.
We provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed domain-adversarial learning
idea over a range of deep architectures and applications. We first consider the simplest
DANN architecture where the three parts (label predictor, domain classifier and feature
extractor) are linear, and demonstrate the success of domain-adversarial learning for such
architecture. The evaluation is performed for synthetic data as well as for the sentiment
analysisprobleminnaturallanguageprocessing, whereDANNimprovesthestate-of-the-art

results on traditional deep learning image data sets—such as MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998)
and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011)—as well as on Office benchmarks (Saenko et al., 2010),
where domain-adversarial learning allows obtaining a deep architecture that considerably
improves over previous state-of-the-art accuracy.
Finally, we evaluate domain-adversarial descriptor learning in the context of person
re-identification application (Gong et al., 2014), where the task is to obtain good pedes-
trian image descriptors that are suitable for retrieval and verification. We apply domain-
adversarial learning, as we consider a descriptor predictor trained with a Siamese-like loss
insteadofthelabelpredictortrainedwithaclassificationloss. Inaseriesofexperiments, we
demonstrate that domain-adversarial learning can improve cross-data-set re-identification
considerably.
2. Related work
Thegeneralapproachofachievingdomainadaptationexploredundermanyfacets. Overthe
years, a large part of the literature has focused mainly on linear hypothesis (see for instance
Blitzer et al., 2006; Bruzzone and Marconcini, 2010; Germain et al., 2013; Baktashmotlagh
etal.,2013;CortesandMohri,2014). Morerecently,non-linearrepresentationshavebecome
increasingly studied, including neural network representations (Glorot et al., 2011; Li et al.,
2014) and most notably the state-of-the-art mSDA (Chen et al., 2012). That literature has
mostly focused on exploiting the principle of robust representations, based on the denoising
autoencoder paradigm (Vincent et al., 2008).
Concurrently, multiple methods of matching the feature distributions in the source and
the target domains have been proposed for unsupervised domain adaptation. Some ap-
3

Ganin,Ustinova,Ajakan,Germain,Larochelle,Laviolette,MarchandandLempitsky
proaches perform this by reweighing or selecting samples from the source domain (Borg-
wardt et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Gong et al., 2013), while others seek an explicit
feature space transformation that would map source distribution into the target one (Pan
et al., 2011; Gopalan et al., 2011; Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013). An important aspect
of the distribution matching approach is the way the (dis)similarity between distributions
is measured. Here, one popular choice is matching the distribution means in the kernel-
reproducing Hilbert space (Borgwardt et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), whereas Gong et al.
(2012) and Fernando et al. (2013) map the principal axes associated with each of the dis-
tributions.
Ourapproachalsoattemptstomatchfeaturespacedistributions, howeverthisisaccom-
plishedbymodifyingthefeaturerepresentationitselfratherthanbyreweighingorgeometric
transformation. Also, our method uses a rather different way to measure the disparity be-
tween distributions based on their separability by a deep discriminatively-trained classifier.
Note also that several approaches perform transition from the source to the target domain
(Gopalan et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2012) by changing gradually the training distribution.
Among these methods, Chopra et al. (2013) does this in a “deep” way by the layerwise
training of a sequence of deep autoencoders, while gradually replacing source-domain sam-
ples with target-domain samples. This improves over a similar approach of Glorot et al.
(2011) that simply trains a single deep autoencoder for both domains. In both approaches,
the actual classifier/predictor is learned in a separate step using the feature representation
learned by autoencoder(s). In contrast to Glorot et al. (2011); Chopra et al. (2013), our
approach performs feature learning, domain adaptation and classifier learning jointly, in a
unified architecture, and using a single learning algorithm (backpropagation). We therefore
argue that our approach is simpler (both conceptually and in terms of its implementation).
Our method also achieves considerably better results on the popular Office benchmark.
While the above approaches perform unsupervised domain adaptation, there are ap-
proaches that perform supervised domain adaptation by exploiting labeled data from the
target domain. In the context of deep feed-forward architectures, such data can be used
to “fine-tune” the network trained on the source domain (Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Oquab
et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2014). Our approach does not require labeled target-domain
data. At the same time, it can easily incorporate such data when they are available.
An idea related to ours is described in Goodfellow et al. (2014). While their goal is
quite different (building generative deep networks that can synthesize samples), the way
they measure and minimize the discrepancy between the distribution of the training data
and the distribution of the synthesized data is very similar to the way our architecture
measures and minimizes the discrepancy between feature distributions for the two domains.
Moreover, the authors mention the problem of saturating sigmoids which may arise at the
early stages of training due to the significant dissimilarity of the domains. The technique
they use to circumvent this issue (the “adversarial” part of the gradient is replaced by a
gradient computed with respect to a suitable cost) is directly applicable to our method.
Also, recent and concurrent reports by Tzeng et al. (2014); Long and Wang (2015)
focusondomainadaptationinfeed-forwardnetworks. Theirsetoftechniquesmeasuresand
minimizes the distance between the data distribution means across domains (potentially,
after embedding distributions into RKHS). Their approach is thus different from our idea
of matching distributions by making them indistinguishable for a discriminative classifier.

Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks
Below, we compare our approach to Tzeng et al. (2014); Long and Wang (2015) on the
Office benchmark. Another approach to deep domain adaptation, which is arguably more
different from ours, has been developed in parallel by Chen et al. (2015).
From a theoretical standpoint, our approach is directly derived from the seminal theo-
retical works of Ben-David et al. (2006, 2010). Indeed, DANN directly optimizes the notion
of H-divergence. We do note the work of Huang and Yates (2012), in which HMM repre-
sentations are learned for word tagging using a posterior regularizer that is also inspired
by Ben-David et al.’s work. In addition to the tasks being different—Huang and Yates
(2012) focus on word tagging problems—, we would argue that DANN learning objective
more closely optimizes the H-divergence, with Huang and Yates (2012) relying on cruder
approximations for efficiency reasons.
A part of this paper has been published as a conference paper (Ganin and Lempitsky,
2015). This version extends Ganin and Lempitsky (2015) very considerably by incorporat-
ing the report Ajakan et al. (2014) (presented as part of the Second Workshop on Transfer
and Multi-Task Learning), which brings in new terminology, in-depth theoretical analy-
sis and justification of the approach, extensive experiments with the shallow DANN case
on synthetic data as well as on a natural language processing task (sentiment analysis).
Furthermore, in this version we go beyond classification and evaluate domain-adversarial
learning for descriptor learning setting within the person re-identification application.
3. Domain Adaptation
We consider classification tasks where X is the input space and Y = {0,1,...,L−1} is the
set of L possible labels. Moreover, we have two different distributions over X×Y, called the
source domain DS and the target domain DT. An unsupervised domain adaptation learning
algorithm is then provided with a labeled source sample S drawn i.i.d. from DS, and an
unlabeled target sample T drawn i.i.d. from DX, where DX is the marginal distribution of

DT over X.

3.1 Domain Divergence
To tackle the challenging domain adaptation task, many approaches bound the target error
by the sum of the source error and a notion of distance between the source and the target
distributions. These methods are intuitively justified by a simple assumption: the source
riskisexpectedtobeagoodindicatorofthetargetriskwhenbothdistributionsaresimilar.
Several notions of distance have been proposed for domain adaptation (Ben-David et al.,
2006, 2010; Mansour et al., 2009a,b; Germain et al., 2013). In this paper, we focus on the
H-divergence used by Ben-David et al. (2006, 2010), and based on the earlier work of Kifer

Ben-David et al. (2006) suggested that, even if it is generally hard to compute (S,T)
H
exactly (e.g., when H is the space of linear classifiers on X), we can easily approximate
it by running a learning algorithm on the problem of discriminating between source and
| target | examples. | To  | do so, | we construct |           | a new | data | set     |     |     |     |     |

In the experiments section of this paper, we compute the PAD value following the
approach of Glorot et al. (2011); Chen et al. (2012), i.e., we train either a linear SVM or
a deeper MLP classifier on a subset of U (Equation 2), and we use the obtained classifier
error on the other subset as the value of (cid:15) in Equation (3). More details and illustrations

The work of Ben-David et al. (2006, 2010) also showed that the H-divergence d (DX,DX)
H S T
is upper bounded by its empirical estimate dˆ (S,T) plus a constant complexity term that
H
depends on the VC dimension of H and the size of samples S and T. By combining this
result with a similar bound on the source risk, the following theorem is obtained.
Theorem 2 (Ben-David et al., 2006) Let H be a hypothesis class of VC dimension d.

The previous result tells us that R (η) can be low only when the β term is low, i.e., only
DT
when there exists a classifier that can achieve a low risk on both distributions. It also tells
us that, to find a classifier with a small R DT (η) in a given class of fixed VC dimension,
the learning algorithm should minimize (in that class) a trade-off between the source risk
(η)andtheempiricalH-divergencedˆ

a strategy to control the H-divergence is to find a representation of the examples where
both the source and the target domain are as indistinguishable as possible. Under such a
representation, a hypothesis with a low source risk will, according to Theorem 2, perform
well on the target data. In this paper, we present an algorithm that directly exploits this
idea.

An original aspect of our approach is to explicitly implement the idea exhibited by Theo-
rem 2 into a neural network classifier. That is, to learn a model that can generalize well
from one domain to another, we ensure that the internal representation of the neural net-

In this section, we detail the proposed approach for incorporating a “domain adaptation
component” to neural networks. In Subsection 4.1, we start by developing the idea for the
simplest possible case, i.e., a single hidden layer, fully connected neural network. We then
describe how to generalize the approach to arbitrary (deep) network architectures.

Let us first consider a standard neural network (NN) architecture with a single hidden
layer. For simplicity, we suppose that the input space is formed by m-dimensional real

Here we have L = |Y|. By using the softmax function, each component of vector
G y (G f (x)) denotes the conditional probability that the neural network assigns x to the
class in Y represented by that component. Given a source example (x ,y ), the natural
i i
classification loss to use is the negative log-probability of the correct label:

|     |     |     |     | (cid:0) |         | (cid:1) |      |      |     |     |

Training the neural network then leads to the following optimization problem on the source

| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The heart of our approach is to design a domain regularizer directly derived from the
H-divergence of Definition 1. To this end, we view the output of the hidden layer G (·)
f
(Equation 4) as the internal representation of the neural network. Thus, we denote the
| source | sample | representations |     | as  |     |                    |          |         |     |     |

Similarly, given an unlabeled sample from the target domain we denote the corresponding
representations
|     |     |     |     |     |     | (cid:8)          | (cid:12) | (cid:9) |     |     |

Let us consider H as the class of hyperplanes in the representation space. Inspired by the
Proxy A-distance (see Section 3.2), we suggest estimating the “min” part of Equation (6)
by a domain classification layer G that learns a logistic regressor G : RD → [0,1],
|     |     |     |     |     |     | d   |        |     |     | d   |     |     |

parameterized by a vector-scalar pair (u,z) ∈ that models the probability that a
given input is from the source domain DX or the target domain DX. Thus,
|        |              |     |       |             |          | S          |            |            | T       |     |     |     |

|        |              |     |       |             |          |            | (cid:0)    |            | (cid:1) |     |     |     |
|        |              |     |       | G (G        | (x);u,z) | = sigm     | u(cid:62)G | (x)+z      | .       |     |     | (7) |

where d denotes the binary variable (domain label) for the i-th example, which indicates
i
whether x come from the source distribution (x ∼DX if d =0) or from the target distribu-
|      | i      |           |     |     |     |     | i   | S i |     |     |     |     |

Recall that for the examples from the source distribution (d i =0), the corresponding
labels y ∈ Y are known at training time. For the examples from the target domains, we
i
do not know the labels at training time, and we want to predict such labels at test time.
This enables us to add a domain adaptation term to the objective of Equation (5), giving

We propose to tackle this problem with a simple stochastic gradient procedure, in which
updatesaremadeintheoppositedirectionofthegradientofEquation(9)fortheminimizing
parameters, and in the direction of the gradient for the maximizing parameters. Stochastic
estimates of the gradient are made, using a subset of the training samples to compute the
averages. Algorithm 1 provides the complete pseudo-code of this learning procedure.3 In
words, during training, the neural network (parameterized by W,b,V,c) and the domain
regressor (parameterized by u,z) are competing against each other, in an adversarial way,
over the objective of Equation (9). For this reason, we refer to networks trained according
to this objective as Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN). DANN will effectively
attempt to learn a hidden layer G (·) that maps an example (either source or target) into
f

Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks
4.2 Generalization to Arbitrary Architectures
For illustration purposes, we’ve so far focused on the case of a single hidden layer DANN.
However,itisstraightforwardtogeneralizetoothersophisticatedarchitectures,whichmight
be more appropriate for the data at hand. For example, deep convolutional neural networks
are well known for being state-of-the-art models for learning discriminative features of
images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
Let us now use a more general notation for the different components of DANN. Namely,
let G (·;θ ) be the D-dimensional neural network feature extractor, with parameters θ .
f f f
Also, let G (·;θ ) be the part of DANN that computes the network’s label prediction out-

put layer, with parameters θ , while G (·;θ ) now corresponds to the computation of the
y d d
domain prediction output of the network, with parameters θ . Note that for preserving
d
the theoretical guarantees of Theorem 2, the hypothesis class H generated by the domain
d
prediction component G should include the hypothesis class H generated by the label
d y
prediction component G . Thus, H ⊆ H .
y y d
We will note the prediction loss and the domain loss respectively by
Li(θ ,θ ) = L (cid:0) G (G (x ;θ );θ ),y (cid:1) ,
y f y y y f i f y i
Li(θ ,θ ) = L (cid:0) G (G (x ;θ );θ ),d ).

Training DANN then parallels the single layer case and consists in optimizing

The updates of Equations (13-15) are very similar to stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
updates for a feed-forward deep model that comprises feature extractor fed into the label

Figure 1: Theproposed architectureincludesadeepfeature extractor(green)andadeep
label predictor (blue), which together form a standard feed-forward architecture.
Unsupervised domain adaptation is achieved by adding a domain classifier (red)
connected to the feature extractor via a gradient reversal layer that multiplies
the gradient by a certain negative constant during the backpropagation-based
training. Otherwise, the training proceeds standardly and minimizes the label
prediction loss (for source examples) and the domain classification loss (for all
samples). Gradient reversal ensures that the feature distributions over the two
domains are made similar (as indistinguishable as possible for the domain classi-
fier), thus resulting in the domain-invariant features.
predictor and into the domain classifier (with loss weighted by λ). The only difference is
that in (13), the gradients from the class and domain predictors are subtracted, instead of
being summed (the difference is important, as otherwise SGD would try to make features
dissimilar across domains in order to minimize the domain classification loss). Since SGD—
and its many variants, such as ADAGRAD (Duchi et al., 2010) or ADADELTA (Zeiler,
2012)—is the main learning algorithm implemented in most libraries for deep learning, it
would be convenient to frame an implementation of our stochastic saddle point procedure
as SGD.
Fortunately, such a reduction can be accomplished by introducing a special gradient
reversal layer (GRL), defined as follows. The gradient reversal layer has no parameters
associated with it. During the forward propagation, the GRL acts as an identity trans-
formation. During the backpropagation however, the GRL takes the gradient from the
subsequent level and changes its sign, i.e., multiplies it by −1, before passing it to the
preceding layer. Implementing such a layer using existing object-oriented packages for deep
learning is simple, requiring only to define procedures for the forward propagation (identity
transformation), and backpropagation (multiplying by −1). The layer requires no parame-
ter update.
The GRL as defined above is inserted between the feature extractor G and the domain
f
classifier G , resulting in the architecture depicted in Figure 1. As the backpropagation
d
process passes through the GRL, the partial derivatives of the loss that is downstream

Running updates (13-15) can then be implemented as doing SGD for (18) and leads
to the emergence of features that are domain-invariant and discriminative at the same
time. After the learning, the label predictor G (G (x;θ );θ ) can be used to predict labels

with a hidden layer size of 15 neurons. We train the NN using the same procedure as the

on the source risk minimization of Equation (5) without any regularizer—and simultane-
ously train the domain regressor of Equation (7) to discriminate between source and target
domains. With this toy experience, we will first illustrate how DANN adapts its decision
boundary when compared to NN. Moreover, we will also illustrate how the representation
given by the hidden layer is less adapted to the source domain task with DANN than with
NN (this is why we need a domain regressor in the NN experiment). We recall that this is
the founding idea behind our proposed algorithm. The analysis of the experiment appears
in Figure 2, where upper graphs relate to standard NN, and lower graphs relate to DANN.
By looking at the lower and upper graphs pairwise, we compare NN and DANN from four

Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks
The column “Label Classification” of Figure 2 shows the decision boundaries of
DANN and NN on the problem of predicting the labels of both source and the target
examples. As expected, NN accurately classifies the two classes of the source sample S,
but is not fully adapted to the target sample T. On the contrary, the decision boundary of
DANN perfectly classifies examples from both source and target samples. In the studied
task, DANN clearly adapts to the target distribution.
The column “Representation PCA” studies how the domain adaptation regularizer
affects the representation G (·) provided by the network hidden layer. The graphs are ob-
f
tained by applying a Principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of all representation of
source and target data points, i.e., S(G )∪T(G ). Thus, given the trained network (NN or
f f
DANN), every point from S and T is mapped into a 15-dimensional feature space through
the hidden layer, and projected back into a two-dimensional plane by the PCA transforma-
tion. In the DANN-PCA representation, we observe that target points are homogeneously
spread out among source points; In the NN-PCA representation, a number of target points
belong to clusters containing no source points. Hence, labeling the target points seems an
easier task given the DANN-PCA representation.
To push the analysis further, the PCA graphs tag four crucial data points by the letters
A, B, C and D, that correspond to the moon extremities in the original space (note that
the original point locations are tagged in the first column graphs). We observe that points
A and B are very close to each other in the NN-PCA representation, while they clearly
belong to different classes. The same happens to points C and D. Conversely, these four
points are at the opposite four corners in the DANN-PCA representation. Note also that
the target point A (resp. D)—that is difficult to classify in the original space—is located
in the “+”cluster (resp. “−−−”cluster) in the DANN-PCA representation. Therefore, the
representation promoted by DANN is better suited to the adaptation problem.
The column “Domain Classification” shows the decision boundary on the domain
classification problem, which is given by the domain regressor G of Equation (7). More

precisely, an example x is classified as a source example when G (G (x)) ≥ 0.5, and is
d f
classified as a domain example otherwise. Remember that, during the learning process
of DANN, the G regressor struggles to discriminate between source and target domains,
d
while the hidden representation G (·) is adversarially updated to prevent it to succeed.
f
As explained above, we trained a domain regressor during the learning process of NN, but
without allowing it to influence the learned representation G (·).
f
On one hand, the DANN domain regressor clearly fails to generalize source and target dis-
tribution topologies. On the other hand, the NN domain regressor shows a better (although
imperfect) generalization capability. Inter alia, it seems to roughly capture the rotation an-
gle of the target distribution. This again corroborates that the DANN representation does
not allow discriminating between domains.
The column “Hidden Neurons” shows the configuration of hidden layer neurons (by
Equation 4, we have that each neuron is indeed a linear regressor). In other words, each
of the fifteen plot line corresponds to the coordinates x ∈ R2 for which the i-th component
of G (x) equals 1, for i ∈ {1,...,15}. We observe that the standard NN neurons are

grouped in three clusters, each one allowing to generate a straight line of the zigzag decision
boundary for the label classification problem. However, most of these neurons are also able
15

Ganin,Ustinova,Ajakan,Germain,Larochelle,Laviolette,MarchandandLempitsky
to (roughly) capture the rotation angle of the domain classification problem. Hence, we
observe that the adaptation regularizer of DANN prevents these kinds of neurons to be
produced. It is indeed striking to see that the two predominant patterns in the NN neurons
(i.e., the two parallel lines crossing the plane from lower left to upper right) are vanishing
in the DANN neurons.
5.1.2 Unsupervised Hyper-Parameter Selection
Toperformunsuperviseddomainadaption,oneshouldprovidewaystosethyper-parameters
(such as the domain regularization parameter λ, the learning rate, the network architecture
for our method) in an unsupervised way, i.e., without referring to labeled data in the
target domain. In the following experiments of Sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.4, we select the
hyper-parameters of each algorithm by using a variant of reverse cross-validation approach
proposed by Zhong et al. (2010), that we call reverse validation.
To evaluate the reverse validation risk associated to a tuple of hyper-parameters, we
proceed as follows. Given the labeled source sample S and the unlabeled target sample T,
we split each set into training sets (S(cid:48) and T(cid:48) respectively, containing 90% of the original
examples) and the validation sets (S and T respectively). We use the labeled set S(cid:48)
V V
and the unlabeled target set T(cid:48) to learn a classifier η. Then, using the same algorithm,
we learn a reverse classifier η using the self-labeled set {(x,η(x))} and the unlabeled
r x∈T(cid:48)
part of S(cid:48) as target sample. Finally, the reverse classifier η is evaluated on the validation
r
set S of source sample. We then say that the classifier η has a reverse validation risk of
V
R (η ). Theprocessisrepeatedwithmultiple valuesofhyper-parameters andtheselected
SV r
parameters are those corresponding to the classifier with the lowest reverse validation risk.
Note that when we train neural network architectures, the validation set S is also
V
used as an early stopping criterion during the learning of η, and self-labeled validation set
{(x,η(x))} is used as an early stopping criterion during the learning of η . We also

observed better accuracies when we initialized the learning of the reverse classifier η with

the configuration learned by the network η.
5.1.3 Experiments on Sentiment Analysis Data Sets
We now compare the performance of our proposed DANN algorithm to a standard neural
network with one hidden layer (NN) described by Equation (5), and a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. We compare the algorithms on the Amazon reviews
data set, as pre-processed by Chen et al. (2012). This data set includes four domains, each
one composed of reviews of a specific kind of product (books, dvd disks, electronics, and
kitchen appliances). Reviews are encoded in 5000 dimensional feature vectors of unigrams
and bigrams, and labels are binary: “0” if the product is ranked up to 3 stars, and “1” if
the product is ranked 4 or 5 stars.
We perform twelve domain adaptation tasks. All learning algorithms are given 2000
labeled source examples and 2000 unlabeled target examples. Then, we evaluate them on
separate target test sets (between 3000 and 6000 examples). Note that NN and SVM do
not use the unlabeled target sample for learning.
Here are more details about the procedure used for each learning algorithms leading to
the empirical results of Table 1.

The “Original data” part of Table 1a shows the target test accuracy of all algorithms,
and Table 1b reports the probability that one algorithm is significantly better than the oth-
ers according to the Poisson binomial test (Lacoste et al., 2012). We note that DANN has
a significantly better performance than NN and SVM, with respective probabilities 0.87
and 0.83. As the only difference between DANN and NN is the domain adaptation regu-
larizer, we conclude that our approach successfully helps to find a representation suitable
for the target domain.
5.1.4 Combining DANN with Denoising Autoencoders
We now investigate on whether the DANN algorithm can improve on the representation
learned by the state-of-the-art Marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (mSDA) pro-
posed by Chen et al. (2012). In brief, mSDA is an unsupervised algorithm that learns a
new robust feature representation of the training samples. It takes the unlabeled parts of
both source and target samples to learn a feature map from input space X to a new rep-
resentation space. As a denoising autoencoders algorithm, it finds a feature representation
fromwhichonecan(approximately)reconstructtheoriginalfeaturesofanexamplefromits
noisy counterpart. Chen et al. (2012) showed that using mSDA with a linear SVM classifier
reaches state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon reviews data sets. As an alternative
to the SVM, we propose to apply our Shallow DANN algorithm on the same representa-
tions generated by mSDA (using representations of both source and target samples). Note
that, even if mSDA and DANN are two representation learning approaches, they optimize
different objectives, which can be complementary.
We perform this experiment on the same Amazon reviews data set described in the
previous subsection. For each source-target domain pair, we generate the mSDA represen-
tations using a corruption probability of 50% and a number of layers of 5. We then execute
the three learning algorithms (DANN, NN, and SVM) on these representations. More pre-
cisely, following the experimental procedure of Chen et al. (2012), we use the concatenation
of the output of the 5 layers and the original input as the new representation. Thus, each
example is now encoded in a vector of 30000 dimensions. Note that we use the same grid
search as in the previous Subsection 5.1.3, but use a learning rate µ of 10−4 for both DANN
and the NN. The results of “mSDA representation” columns in Table 1a confirm that com-
bining mSDA and DANN is a sound approach. Indeed, the Poisson binomial test shows
that DANN has a better performance than the NN and the SVM, with probabilities 0.92
and 0.88 respectively, as reported in Table 1b. We note however that the standard NN
and the SVM find the best solution on respectively the second and the fourth tasks. This
suggests that DANN and mSDA adaptation strategies are not fully complementary.

already points out some evidence for that and here we provide analysis on real data. To
do so, we compare the Proxy A-distance (PAD) on various representations of the Amazon
Reviews data set; these representations are obtained by running either NN, DANN, mSDA,

or mSDA and DANN combined. Recall that PAD, as described in Section 3.2, is a metric
estimating the similarity of the source and the target representations. More precisely, to
obtain a PAD value, we use the following procedure: (1) we construct the data set U of
Equation (2) using both source and target representations of the training samples; (2) we
randomly split U in two subsets of equal size; (3) we train linear SVMs on the first subset
of U using a large range of C values; (4) we compute the error of all obtained classifiers
on the second subset of U; and (5) we use the lowest error to compute the PAD value of
| Equation | (3). |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Firstly, Figure 3a compares the PAD of DANN representations obtained in the experi-
ments of Section 5.1.3 (using the hyper-parameters values leading to the results of Table 1)
to the PAD computed on raw data. As expected, the PAD values are driven down by the
DANN representations.
Secondly,Figure3bcomparesthePADofDANNrepresentationstothePADofstandard
NN representations. As the PAD is influenced by the hidden layer size (the discriminating
power tends to increase with the representation length), we fix here the size to 100 neurons
for both algorithms. We also fix the adaptation parameter of DANN to λ (cid:39) 0.31; it was
the value that has been selected most of the time during our preceding experiments on the
Amazon Reviews data set. Again, DANN is clearly leading to the lowest PAD values.
Lastly, Figure 3c presents two sets of results related to Section 5.1.4 experiments. On
one hand, we reproduce the results of Chen et al. (2012), which noticed that the mSDA
representations have greater PAD values than original (raw) data. Although the mSDA
approach clearly helps to adapt to the target task, it seems to contradict the theory of Ben-
David et al.. On the other hand, we observe that, when running DANN on top of mSDA
(usingthehyper-parametersvaluesleadingtotheresultsofTable1), theobtainedrepresen-
tations have much lower PAD values. These observations might explain the improvements

5.2 Experiments with Deep Networks on Image Classification
We now perform extensive evaluation of a deep version of DANN (see Subsection 4.2) on a
number of popular image data sets and their modifications. These include large-scale data
setsofsmallimagespopularwithdeeplearningmethods, andtheOfficedatasets(Saenko
et al., 2010), which are a de facto standard for domain adaptation in computer vision, but
have much fewer images.
5.2.1 Baselines
Thefollowingbaselinesareevaluatedintheexperimentsofthissubsection. Thesource-only
model is trained without consideration for target-domain data (no domain classifier branch
included into the network). The train-on-target model is trained on the target domain with
class labels revealed. This model serves as an upper bound on DA methods, assuming that
target data are abundant and the shift between the domains is considerable.
In addition, we compare our approach against the recently proposed unsupervised DA
method based on subspace alignment (SA) (Fernando et al., 2013), which is simple to setup
and test on new data sets, but has also been shown to perform very well in experimental
comparisons with other “shallow” DA methods. To boost the performance of this baseline,
we pick its most important free parameter (the number of principal components) from the
range{2,...,60},sothatthetestperformanceonthetargetdomainismaximized. Toapply
SA in our setting, we train a source-only model and then consider the activations of the last
hidden layer in the label predictor (before the final linear classifier) as descriptors/features,
and learn the mapping between the source and the target domains (Fernando et al., 2013).
Since the SA baseline requires training a new classifier after adapting the features, and
in order to put all the compared settings on an equal footing, we retrain the last layer of
the label predictor using a standard linear SVM (Fan et al., 2008) for all four considered
methods (including ours; the performance on the target domain remains approximately the
same after the retraining).
For the Office data set (Saenko et al., 2010), we directly compare the performance of
our full network (feature extractor and label predictor) against recent DA approaches using
previously published results.
5.2.2 CNN architectures and Training Procedure
Ingeneral,wecomposefeatureextractorfromtwoorthreeconvolutionallayers,pickingtheir
exact configurations from previous works. More precisely, four different architectures were
used in our experiments. The first three are shown in Figure 4. For the Office domains,
we use pre-trained AlexNet from the Caffe-package (Jia et al., 2014). The adaptation
architecture is identical to Tzeng et al. (2014).5
For the domain adaption component, we use three (x→1024→1024→2) fully connected
layers, except for MNIST where we used a simpler (x→100→2) architecture to speed up
the experiments. Admittedly these choices for domain classifier are arbitrary, and better
adaptation performance might be attained if this part of the architecture is tuned.

The other hyper-parameters are not selected through a grid search as in the small scale

between the success of the adaptation in terms of the classification accuracy for the target
domain, and the overlap between the domain distributions in such visualizations.
5.2.4 Results On Image Data Sets
We now discuss the experimental settings and the results. In each case, we train on the
source data set and test on a different target domain data set, with considerable shifts
between domains (see Figure 6). The results are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.
MNIST → MNIST-M. Our first experiment deals with the MNIST data set (LeCun et al.,
1998) (source). In order to obtain the target domain (MNIST-M) we blend digits from the
original set over patches randomly extracted from color photos from BSDS500 (Arbelaez
et al., 2011). This operation is formally defined for two images I1,I2 as Iout = |I1 −I2 |,
ijk ijk ijk
where i,j are the coordinates of a pixel and k is a channel index. In other words, an output
sample is produced by taking a patch from a photo and inverting its pixels at positions
corresponding to the pixels of a digit. For a human the classification task becomes only
slightly harder compared to the original data set (the digits are still clearly distinguishable)
whereas for a CNN trained on MNIST this domain is quite distinct, as the background and
the strokes are no longer constant. Consequently, the source-only model performs poorly.
Our approach succeeded at aligning feature distributions (Figure 5), which led to successful
adaptation results (considering that the adaptation is unsupervised). At the same time,
the improvement over source-only model achieved by subspace alignment (SA) (Fernando
et al., 2013) is quite modest, thus highlighting the difficulty of the adaptation task.
Synthetic numbers → SVHN. To address a common scenario of training on synthetic data
and testing on real data, we use Street-View House Number data set SVHN (Netzer et al.,
2011) as the target domain and synthetic digits as the source. The latter (Syn Numbers)
consists of ≈ 500,000 images generated by ourselves from WindowsTM fonts by varying the
text (that includes different one-, two-, and three-digit numbers), positioning, orientation,
backgroundandstrokecolors, andtheamountofblur. Thedegreesofvariationwerechosen
manually to simulate SVHN, however the two data sets are still rather distinct, the biggest
difference being the structured clutter in the background of SVHN images.
The proposed backpropagation-based technique works well covering almost 80% of the
gap between training with source data only and training on target domain data with known
target labels. In contrast, SA (Fernando et al., 2013) results in a slight classification ac-
curacy drop (probably due to the information loss during the dimensionality reduction),
indicatingthattheadaptationtaskisevenmorechallengingthaninthecaseoftheMNIST
experiment.
MNIST ↔ SVHN. In this experiment, we further increase the gap between distributions,
and test on MNIST and SVHN, which are significantly different in appearance. Training
on SVHN even without adaptation is challenging — classification error stays high during
the first 150 epochs. In order to avoid ending up in a poor local minimum we, therefore, do
not use learning rate annealing here. Obviously, the two directions (MNIST → SVHN and
SVHN → MNIST) are not equally difficult. As SVHN is more diverse, a model trained
on SVHN is expected to be more generic and to perform reasonably on the MNIST data
set. This, indeed, turns out to be the case and is supported by the appearance of the

synthetic images (which we call Syn Signs) simulating various imaging conditions. In the
target domain, we use 31,367 random training samples for unsupervised adaptation and the

sets, Office is rather small-scale with only 2817 labeled images spread across 31 different
categories in the largest domain. The amount of available data is crucial for a successful
training of a deep model, hence we opted for the fine-tuning of the CNN pre-trained on
the ImageNet (AlexNet from the Caffe package, see Jia et al., 2014) as it is done in some
recent DA works (Donahue et al., 2014; Tzeng et al., 2014; Hoffman et al., 2013; Long and
Wang, 2015). We make our approach more comparable with Tzeng et al. (2014) by using
exactlythesamenetworkarchitecturereplacingdomainmean-basedregularizationwiththe
domain classifier.
Followingpreviousworks, weassesstheperformanceofourmethodacrossthreetransfer
tasks most commonly used for evaluation. Our training protocol is adopted from Gong
et al. (2013); Chopra et al. (2013); Long and Wang (2015) as during adaptation we use
all available labeled source examples and unlabeled target examples (the premise of our
method is the abundance of unlabeled data in the target domain). Also, all source domain
data are used for training. Under this “fully-transductive” setting, our method is able
to improve previously-reported state-of-the-art accuracy for unsupervised adaptation very
considerably (Table 3), especially in the most challenging Amazon → Webcam scenario
(the two domains with the largest domain shift).
Interestingly, in all three experiments we observe a slight over-fitting (performance on
the target domain degrades while accuracy on the source continues to improve) as training
progresses, however, it doesn’t ruin the validation accuracy. Moreover, switching off the
domain classifier branch makes this effect far more apparent, from which we conclude that
our technique serves as a regularizer.
5.3 Experiments with Deep Image Descriptors for Re-Identification
In this section we discuss the application of the described adaptation method to person
re-identification (re-id) problem. The task of person re-identification is to associate people
seen from different camera views. More formally, it can be defined as follows: given two
sets of images from different cameras (probe and gallery) such that each person depicted in
the probe set has an image in the gallery set, for each image of a person from the probe
set find an image of the same person in the gallery set. Disjoint camera views, different
illumination conditions, various poses and low quality of data make this problem difficult
even for humans (e.g., Liu et al., 2013, reports human performance at Rank1=71.08%).
Unlikeclassificationproblemsthatarediscussedabove,re-identificationproblemimplies
that each image is mapped to a vector descriptor. The distance between descriptors is then
used to match images from the probe set and the gallery set. To evaluate results of re-id
methods the Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curve is commonly used. It is a plot
of the identification rate (recall) at rank-k, that is the probability of the matching gallery
imagetobewithintheclosestk images(intermsofdescriptordistance)totheprobeimage.
Most existing works train descriptor mappings and evaluate them within the same data
set containing images from a certain camera network with similar imaging conditions. Sev-
eral papers, however, observed that the performance of the resulting re-identification sys-
tems drops very considerably when descriptors trained on one data set and tested on an-
other. Itisthereforenaturaltohandlesuchcross-domainevaluationasadomain-adaptation

re-identification data sets. The three data sets are treated as different domains
in our experiments.
Recently,severalpaperswithsignificantlyimprovedre-identificationperformance(Zhang
and Saligrama, 2014; Zhao et al., 2014; Paisitkriangkrai et al., 2015) have been presented,
with Ma et al. (2015) reporting good results in cross-data-set evaluation scenario. At the
moment,deeplearningmethods(Yietal.,2014)donotachievestate-of-the-artresultsprob-
ably because of the limited size of the training sets. Domain adaptation thus represents a
viable direction for improving deep re-identification descriptors.
5.3.1 Data Sets and Protocols
Following Ma et al. (2015), we use PRID (Hirzer et al., 2011), VIPeR (Gray et al., 2007),
CUHK (Li and Wang, 2013) as target data sets for our experiments. The PRID data set
exists in two versions, and as in Ma et al. (2015) we use a single-shot variant. It contains
imagesof385personsviewedfromcameraAandimagesof749personsviewedfromcamera
B, 200 persons appear in both cameras. The VIPeR data set also contains images taken
withtwocameras, andintotal632personsarecaptured, foreverypersonthereisoneimage
for each of the two camera views. The CUHK data set consists of images from five pairs of
cameras, two images for each person from each of the two cameras. We refer to the subset
of this data set that includes the first pair of cameras only as CUHK/p1 (as most papers
use this subset). See Figure 8 for samples of these data sets.
We perform extensive experiments for various pairs of data sets, where one data set
serves as a source domain, i.e., it is used to train a descriptor mapping in a supervised
way with known correspondences between probe and gallery images. The second data set is
used as a target domain, so that images from that data set are used without probe-gallery
correspondence.
Inmoredetail,CUHK/p1isusedforexperimentswhenCUHKservesasatargetdomain

and all others for testing. For CUHK, 971 persons are split into 485 for training and 486
for testing. Unlike Ma et al. (2015), we use all images in the first pair of cameras of CUHK
instead of choosing one image of a person from each camera view. We also performed two
27

Ganin,Ustinova,Ajakan,Germain,Larochelle,Laviolette,MarchandandLempitsky
experiments with all images of the whole CUHK data set as source domain and VIPeR and
PRID data sets as target domains as in the original paper (Yi et al., 2014).
Following Yi et al. (2014), we augmented our data with mirror images, and during
test time we calculate similarity score between two images as the mean of the four scores
corresponding to different flips of the two compared images. In case of CUHK, where there
are 4 images (including mirror images) for each of the two camera views for each person,
all 16 combinations’ scores are averaged.
5.3.2 CNN architectures and Training Procedure
In our experiments, we use siamese architecture described in Yi et al. (2014) (Deep Metric
Learning or DML) for learning deep image descriptors on the source data set. This archi-
tecture incorporates two convolution layers (with 7 × 7 and 5 × 5 filter banks), followed
by ReLU and max pooling, and one fully-connected layer, which gives 500-dimensional de-
scriptors as an output. There are three parallel flows within the CNN for processing three
part of an image: the upper, the middle, and the lower one. The first convolution layer
shares parameters between three parts, and the outputs of the second convolution layers
are concatenated. During training, we follow Yi et al. (2014) and calculate pairwise cosine
similarities between 500-dimensional features within each batch and backpropagate the loss
for all pairs within batch.
To perform domain-adversarial training, we construct a DANN architecture. The fea-
ture extractor includes the two convolutional layers (followed by max-pooling and ReLU)
discussed above. The label predictor in this case is replaced with descriptor predictor that
includesonefully-connectedlayer. Thedomainclassifierincludestwofully-connectedlayers
with 500 units in the intermediate representation (x→500→1).
For the verification loss function in the descriptor predictor we used Binomial Deviance
loss, defined in Yi et al. (2014) with similar parameters: α = 2, β = 0.5, c = 2 (the
asymmetriccostparameterfornegativepairs). Thedomainclassifieristrainedwithlogistic
loss as in subsection 5.2.2.
We used learning rate fixed to 0.001 and momentum of 0.9. The schedule of adaptation
similar to the one described in subsection 5.2.2 was used. We also inserted dropout layer
with rate 0.5 after the concatenation of outputs of the second max-pooling layer. 128-sized
batches were used for source data and 128-sized batches for target data.
5.3.3 Results on Re-identification data sets
Figure 9 shows results in the form of CMC-curves for eight pairs of data sets. Depending on
the hardness of the annotation problem we trained either for 50,000 iterations (CUHK/p1
→ VIPeR, VIPeR → CUHK/p1, PRID → VIPeR) or for 20,000 iterations (the other five
pairs).
After the sufficient number of iterations, domain-adversarial training consistently im-
proves the performance of re-identification. For the pairs that involve PRID data set, which
is more dissimilar to the other two data sets, the improvement is considerable. Overall,
this demonstrates the applicability of the domain-adversarial learning beyond classification
problems.

Figure 10: The effect of adaptation shown by t-SNE visualizations of source and target
domains descriptors in a VIPeR → CUHK/p1 experiment pair. VIPeR is de-
picted with green and CUHK/p1 - with red. As in the image classification case,
domain-adversarial learning ensures a closer match between the source and the
target distributions.
Figure 10 further demonstrates the effect of adaptation on the distributions of the
learned descriptors in the source and in target sets in VIPeR → CUHK/p1 experiments,
where domain adversarial learning once again achieves better intermixing of the two do-
mains.
6. Conclusion
The paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation of feed-forward neural networks,
which allows large-scale training based on large amount of annotated data in the source
domain and large amount of unannotated data in the target domain. Similarly to many
previous shallow and deep DA techniques, the adaptation is achieved through aligning the
distributions of features across the two domains. However, unlike previous approaches, the
alignment is accomplished through standard backpropagation training.
TheapproachismotivatedandsupportedbythedomainadaptationtheoryofBen-David
et al. (2006, 2010). The main idea behind DANN is to enjoin the network hidden layer to
learn a representation which is predictive of the source example labels, but uninformative
about the domain of the input (source or target). We implement this new approach within
both shallow and deep feed-forward architectures. The latter allows simple implementation
within virtually any deep learning package through the introduction of a simple gradient
reversal layer. We have shown that our approach is flexible and achieves state-of-the-art

A convenient aspect of our approach is that the domain adaptation component can be
added to almost any neural network architecture that is trainable with backpropagation.
Towards this end, We have demonstrated experimentally that the approach is not confined
